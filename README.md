# Javalin

In the repo documents, the sound player is an open source little java extension to use the built in sound stream function

The main is just a test bed, I used it to test sounds

The issues I am facing is that it is difficult to load and unload different audio files from the app
and accessing these different files from different nested methods within the java applet doesnt seem to work since each method calls its own version of the audio stream API.
